# ♟️ Chess Time Management Dashboard

This project explores how factors like time spent, game phase, piece moved in a chess game relates to move quality, using data collected from my own games. [Profile](https://www.chess.com/member/OkayKev)

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored
- Does spending more time on a move result in higher move quality?
- How does time management vary across game phases (opening, middlegame, endgame)?
- What pieces do I blunder most with?
